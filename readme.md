Clairty is a set of Rainmeter skins with the goal of simple, easy to read, system monitoring that gets out of the way. 

Clarity is based on "[mii system skin 2](http://abu46.deviantart.com/art/mii-system-skin-2-206965499)", authored by DeviantArt user abu46, and provided without license as of December 2017.
These files are not required for Clarity to run.

----------------------------------------------
## Requirements

1. Rainmeter 4.1
2. MSI Afterburner installed and running 

	The following monitors enabled (`MSI Afterburner Settings -> Monitoring`):

  * GPU temperature
  * GPU usage
  * Fan speed
  * Core clock
  * Memory clock
  * Memory Usage
  * Framerate
  * GPU Voltage

If you don't intend to run the specific skins that display the above, feel free to disable the monitoring you don't need.

## Installation

Installation is pretty simple:


1. Copy `Clarity\` folder into `\Documents\Rainmeter\Skins\`
2. Copy `Clarity\MSIAfterburner.dll` into `\Program Files\Rainmeter\Plugins\`


### Modifications:

My git config converts Windows line breaks to Unix line breaks on upload. If you're having issues, you might need to switch the 
line breaks in the config files.
