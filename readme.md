Clairty is a set of Rainmeter skins with the goal of simple, easy to read, system monitoring that gets out of the way. 

Clarity is based on "mii system skin 2", authored by DeviantArt user abu46, and provided without license as of December 2017.
They can be found [[here](http://abu46.deviantart.com/art/mii-system-skin-2-206965499), and are not required for Clarity to run

----------------------------------------------

Clarity requires MSI Afterburner and Coretemp installed and running in the background at all times.
The following should be enabled (MSI Afterburner Settings->Monitoring):
GPU temperature
GPU usage
Fan speed
Core clock
Memory clock
Memory Usage
Framerate
GPU Voltage

If you don't intend to run the specific skins that display the above, feel free to disable the monitoring you don't need. 

----------------------------------------------
Installation:


1. Copy `Clarity\` folder into `\Documents\Rainmeter\Skins\`

2. Copy `Clarity\MSIAfterburner.dll` into `\Program Files\Rainmeter\Plugins\`

-----------------------------------------------

Modifications:

My git config converts Windows line breaks to Unix line breaks on upload. If you're having issues, you might need to switch the 
line breaks in the config files.
